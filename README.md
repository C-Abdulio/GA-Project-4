![ArtFinga-CURRENT_VERSION](https://github.com/C-Abdulio/GA-Project-4/blob/master/ArtFinga/client/src/resource/ScreenShot.png)
Artfinga is simple touched based painting tool that uses an imported HTML Canvas element to allow users to draw and paint using nothing much but their finger. Users can use the button component to change colors and shift between 4 size options.

After the user finishes their artwork, thy can save their pictures and give them a title, so they can put into a gallery. The gallery will display each and every drawing the user has created, kongside their title

AT Post MVP, I would like to restrict saving the picture  register a user with have a secure password
